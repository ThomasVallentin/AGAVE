  <H1>AGAVE - Animated Geometric Algebra Viewer for Experiments</H1>
</div>

**AGAVE** is a procedural tool to generate shapes using Conformal Geometric Algebra. It is my end-of-the-year project for the Geometric Algebra course I took at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel.

[![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43669549/228780772-f63ac6d8-2f67-44ed-93f0-40e8f85d3ea9.png)](https://youtu.be/BwJDvLdODqc)

## Dependencies

AGAVE relies on some dependencies, the followings are submodules of the repository : 

- GLFW3
- glm
- Dear ImGui
- stb

And these ones are hard copied in the project as they can't be referenced as the other ones : 

- Garamon C3GA 
  *(Special case here, the project is available at [https://github.com/vincentnozick/garamon](https://github.com/vincentnozick/garamon) but this project is not the library but a project that generates a CGN library. I choosed to add the C3GA algebra generated by Garamon directly in AGAVE instead of having the user taking care of this extra step)*
- Glad (OpenGL 4.6)

## Install

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ThomasVallentin/AGAVE.git
cd AGAVE
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
